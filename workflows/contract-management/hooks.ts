/**
 * Contract Management Workflow Hooks
 * 
 * Hooks are used to pause workflow execution and wait for human input.
 * They enable "human-in-the-loop" checkpoints in the workflow.
 * 
 * Each hook defines a schema that validates the approval response,
 * ensuring type safety and data validation.
 * 
 * Workflow Usage:
 * - contractApprovalHook: Used for legal team approval (required for all contracts)
 * - contractManagerReviewHook: Used for contract manager review (optional, for requester-initiated contracts)
 * - counterpartyReviewHook: Used for external counterparty review (separate workflow)

 * - by: Email of the approver
 * - redlineSuggestions: Optional suggestions for contract changes
